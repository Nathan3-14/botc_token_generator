# Blood on the Clocktower - Token Maker
# ADD CHANGED MARKERS TO WHAT I CHANGED, ALSO REMOVE THIS

This project allows to create tokens to print and play Blood on the Clocktower. The tokens will be added to a pdf to simplify the printing. 

Custom Scaling: to be released...

Token Examples:
![tokens_examples](img/tokens_examples.png "Tokens Examples")

Reminder Examples:
![reminders_examples](img/reminders_examples.png "Reminders Examples")


The ability to print only a subset of tokens is not implemented here, but could be a future release. There are still workarounds, like removing them from characters.txt or editing the scripts.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Comes with Python installation.
- **Virtual Environment Tools**: `venv`.

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EhdiB/botc_token_generator.git
cd botc_token_generator
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
#### Option A: Using setup.sh Script (Recommended)
We have a simple setup.sh script that automates setting up the virtual environment and installing dependencies. To use it:

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Run the setup.sh script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment called botc_tokens_env.
- Activate the environment.
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt.


#### Option B: Manually Using virtualenv
If you prefer to set up the environment manually, you can follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment (you can replace botc_tokens_env by a preferred enviroment name):
```bash
python -m venv botc_tokens_env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- Linux/Mac: source myenv/bin/activate
- Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Run the Application
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, we can get started!

Run the following command in the terminal to give the script execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x run_all.sh
```


Execute the script with:
```bash
./run_all.sh
```


**All files will be save in the "output_prints" folder**


## Features
To run a specific function, run the following (replacing PythonFileName with any of the feature functions): 
```bash
python {PythonFileName}.py [file_path]
```


If running for the first time, it is recommended to run them using the following order:

- Feature 1: `get_assets_from_wiki.py`
    - This program scrapes the assets from the official wiki. 
    - Some links are hardcoded as they were not directly scappable 
    - The scrapper may become obsolete if there are changes to the urls of the wiki. If so, feel free to contact me so I can implement a fix.
    - The optional file path will change what character list is used. The default  is `characters.txt`.
- Feature 2: `generate_tokens_and_reminders.py`
    - This will generate all tokens and all reminders for all characters
    - Background can be changed
    - Reminders listed in the characters.json
    - The optional file path will change what file is used to generate the ability text and leaves. The default is `characters.json`.
- Feature 3: `save_tokens_to_pdf.py`
    - This places all the tokens and reminders on a pdf to prepare from printing
    - The optional folder path changes where the output go. The default is `./output_tokens`.
- Feature 4: `generate_night_order_sheet.py`
    - Allow the creation of the night order sheets for first and other nights
    - Can be printed on A4, and folded in 2
